## Heading ##
  Kango â€“ Funding for Animal Shelters

## Sub-Heading ##
  Kango is a non-profit* crowdsourcing platform that enables individual donors to directly fund animal shelters in need.

## Summary ##
  Kango allows donors to support animal shelters in need.  Donors can sponsor a particular pet and see their donation in action.  Shelters send donors information about how their donation saved the life of their sponsored animal.  Donors also receive tax deductions, improved public persona, and eternal gratitude.

## Problem ##
  Animal shelters are overcrowded and do not have enough resources to deal with their high demand.

## Solution ##
  Kango allows donors to directly help animal shelters receive the food, blankets, medical supplies and general upkeep that they need.
