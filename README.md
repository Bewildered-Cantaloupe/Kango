## Usage

How Kango Works:
> Individual users can browse local animal shelters that are need of monetary donations for food, healthcare, blankets, and general upkeep. Users can then sign up for an account and donate to the shelter(s) of their choice. Kango incentivises higher donations by displaying a donation leaderboard per shelter. 

Stack:
> Kango uses the RRENS stack (ReFlux, React, Express, Node, and SQLite3).

Authentication:
> Kango uses Passport, OAuth, and Twitter to authenticate users. Users are able to sign up/sign in using either a local username and password or their Twitter account. Users can also connect their local login information with their Twitter account.

Database Requests:
> Kango uses Bookshelf and Knex to manage SQLite3 integration with the Express server. POST requests can be used to add data while GET requests can be used for lookup.

POST endpoints:
> /shelter?sheltername
sheltername is a unique, one word, username for the shelter that you are adding. Data should be sent as an object with the following data:
var shelter = {
    name      : 'Full Name Of Shelter',
    image_url : 'www.imagelink.com',
    address_1 : 'First line of address',
    address_2 : 'second line of address',
    city      : 'city name',
    state     : 'state initials eg CA',
    zip       : 'zip code as INT',
    email     : 'shelter@email.com',
    telephone : 'phone number as INT',
    bio       : 'Biography no length limit',
    goal      : 'goal as INT'
}

> /donate
Adds new donation. Send data as object with the following data:
var donation = {
    donation    : 'donation amount as INT',
    username    : 'username of donator',
    sheltername : 'sheltername of receiving shelter'
}

GET endpoints:
> /shelters
